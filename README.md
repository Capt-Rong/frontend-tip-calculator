# Frontend Mentor - Tip Calculator App

This is my solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). The goal was to build a responsive tip calculator that allows users to quickly and accurately split bills and tips.

## Overview

This app lets users:
- Enter a bill amount
- Select a tip percentage or enter a custom tip
- Enter the number of people splitting the bill
- See the tip amount and total per person
- Reset all fields easily

The app is fully responsive and provides instant feedback for invalid inputs (e.g., zero or negative numbers, non-numeric input).
